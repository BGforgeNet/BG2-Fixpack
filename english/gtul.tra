Having lost friends and loved ones to a series of raids by hill giants, Garrar The Powerful made it his mission to cleanse his homeland of their presence.  It is not known where he acquired this item, but with it he single-handedly dispatched dozens of the creatures, all the while protected from the blows of their clubs.  The remaining giants fled to neighboring lands, lands that lacked a similar champion and did not fare as well.

@1010185 = ~When asked about his past, MINSC proclaims that he is a berserker warrior from the nation of Rashemen in the utter east, though his affinity for animals speaks to his skill as a ranger as well. He originally came to the Sword Coast on a dajemma, a ritual journey to manhood, as the bodyguard of a young Wychalarn of Rashemen named Dynaheir. To his shame, Dynaheir is now dead, and he fears that the doors of the honored Ice Dragon Berserker Lodge are forever closed to him. This personal tragedy has obviously not strengthened Minsc's hold on reality, as evidenced by his continued dependence on his animal companion 'Boo', a creature that he claims is a miniature giant space hamster. Apparently such things do exist somewhere in the Realms, but Minsc has surely taken too many blows to the head.~ []

@1019044 = ~Two-Handed Sword, Cursed Berserking +3
This is a cursed sword which performs perfectly under every test, save the heat of battle.  Upon entering combat, the wielder will immediately go berserk, killing everything within reach until either calming down or falling unconscious.  A very powerful sword, but one must decide whether or not it is worth the risk.  Even after the battle-fury has ended, this sword can only be removed via an exorcism using a remove curse spell.

@1019045 = ~The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword.  Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons.  In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened.  Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword.  The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.  This one is particularly good at its job as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.

Whereas the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence.  The "shamshir", as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point.  The effect of this is that it is slightly slower but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat.

A contact of Isaea's is named Barg and can be located at the docks in the Docks District.

Level: 7
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None

Uttering a holy word spell creates magic of tremendous power.  The priest acts as a bridge between his god and the prime material plane causing a small explosion centered on the priest and reaching up to a 30' radius.  It affects only evil creatures or undead of any alignment that are caught in the area of effect.  The effects differ according to the level of the target as follows:

Hit Dice or levels  --  Effects of Holy word
Less than 4  --  Death
4 to 7  --  Stunned for 1 turn
8 to 11  --  Slowed for 1 turn with 75% chance of spell failure
12 and up  --  Deafened for 1 turn with 50% chance of spell failure

There is no saving throw vs. this spell and the effects last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.  Note this spell may not be cast by any priest of evil alignment.~

@1025876 = ~Stoneskin (Alteration)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon himself, an outer skin of stone will move up from the ground completely covering him.  This skin is of course magical and will hinder the wizard in no way.  The effect of this is to protect the wizard from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles.  For every 2 levels of the caster an additional skin is gained upon casting, for example a 10th level wizard would receive 5 skins while a 20th level wizard would receive 10.  For each skin the wizard possesses the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against him, but the sixth would affect him normally.  The skins will remain on the wizard until he is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires.  It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any magical attacks such as fireball.~
@1025991 = ~Interesting, but not of much help. Lots of people carry or wear leather.~ []

Ending the Plague of Teeth

This tome is quite ancient, and you do not recognize the tongue in which it is written. Fortunately, Bodhi has scrawled a translation of selected passages in the margins, as well as further questions she apparently wished to ask on the subject.

Stuat tuo Gotha: 
The resolution:
With the witch at the fore, long previous to her treachery, we did stride the hills of Umar seeking comfort in our hour of need. The time had come for the living to mourn no more, and the blades that were fettered by sentiment were cut free, and it was decided that we would speak for our lives with the sinews of our sword arms. The honored dead that did take flight in the darkness of shadow would no more receive sorrow from those of us that had lost their friends and relatives to the plague of teeth. 

Mornat de'pas Golvana Fathorn:
Battles when came the dead:
There came we, the army of light, armed with faith and conviction, and we did march unto the tombs of the restless dead during hours of day. With wooden edge we struck down master and slave, though many paid for each thrust with their lives. In the fallen there was the danger of a scourge anew, and many of the newly infected seemed doomed to walk again with dire purpose. 

Aegato Davon:
The plea:
"No more" cried we! No more would we lose to the plague. These new fallen could not be abandoned. We had fought for our lives and theirs, and they would not be taken. To the Temple we went, to the god of Sun and Light. Amaunator would save them. Amaunator, whose touch turns shadows to fire. In the arms of the Sun god were the infected placed, and the hearts of their dark masters were laid there with them. Blood did burn, and the dead returned, but not as undead or unliving, but alive and freed from taint. Many did walk the light side home, when last the plague did fall.

Relevance of archaic worship of Amaunator?
Origin of vampiric plague?
Any link to a modern cure to be worried of?
Historical document or historical fiction?

A final note is scribbled...

There are, at this moment, beasts of huge size and ferocity rampaging on my lands. Ogres and their fell kin have killed my peoples and tenants, and I have not the means to rout them. For all that is good, will you descend upon them with your righteousness? I await your response.

@1034090 = ~Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but as an idiot.  As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious Treant.  He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match.  Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "Treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak.  His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree.  That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was in the first, didn't realize the truth.  He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero.  Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance".
It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence.  If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity.  He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.
As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away.  Banter such as "Ouch, that musta hurt", "Oh yeah!  Got 'im good", and "Beware my bite for it might...might...might really hurt or something" is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.

@1034171 = ~TWO-HANDED:

NOTE:  Magical two-handed weapons are more powerful than their single-handed counterparts.  This counter balances the fact that you can't use a second weapon or shield when using a two-handed weapon.  The Holy avenger and Vorpal sword are examples of weapons that are two-handed.

This weapon class allows the character to use a two-handed weapon and receive special bonuses.  If one slot is spent on this proficiency the wielder gets a +1 bonus to damage and a -2 bonus to speed when using a two-handed weapon.  The character will also score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20).  A second slot spent on this proficiency gives a further -2 bonus to speed while wielding two-handed weapons.~

@1036338 = ~A derivative of the long sword, the two-handed sword is significantly longer, both in blade and hilt.  Its primary function is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.  This magical version is even more capable of such functions, serving as a fearful reminder of what comes of the union between weapons and sorcery.

This scimitar is of rather poor quality but beneath its surface lies great power and evil.  Created for the sole purpose of slaying Harpers, Shazzellim is more than capable of that task.  With one strike of the blade a bard must make a saving throw vs. spells or die.  Crafted by a Red Wizard of Thay, the sword also has the ability to vocalize, which is why it was often given to fighter-mages in the service of the Wizards.  Needless to say, possession of this sword would not be looked upon very highly by Harpers.

@1039470 = ~Two-Handed Sword +3: Harbinger
When the hero Trueblood destroyed the Harbinger, a demon gorging itself on the blood of peasant folk near Luskan, he bound its essence in the only vessel capable of holding it, his fabled sword, Deliverance.  Though the evil creature was dominated by the will of the semi-sentient blade, it was not truly defeated, and it transformed the weapon from within.  Now it acts much like any other enchanted weapon, but when it strikes, there is a small chance that a fireball erupts, a sign that the demon within still rages at its imprisonment.  There is also a chance that any ogre it hits will be turned to stone.  Whether this is an ability of the demon or a vestigial power of the original blade is not known.

A social faux pas placed upstart Andor Licon in a duel with Baron Eeirk, heir to a warrior king.  Though they seemed of even skill, Andor grew oddly weaker with each hit of the Baron's family blade.  Panicking, he bade his bodyguards kill Eeirk.  Despite his claims of morality, some noted that the young noble had positioned his men before the duel was even underway, and though he professed disdain for its dark magic, Andor made a tidy fortune off the sale of the evil blade.

Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerun, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten, such that the sword itself never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today.  It is infused with the very essence of virtue, and requires as much from any paladin that would hope to wield it.  The evils of the Realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, their magic dispelled with a word, steadfastly resisted with ease.  Carsomyr also harbors a special distaste for the forces of evil and chaos, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle.

The title does not refer to the blade itself, but rather to the woman who originally wielded it in the icy hinterlands of Faerun.  Her name was Carerra, and she was a veritable firestorm that swept across arctic trolls and the northern orcish tribes.  She was a hated enemy of many a shaman whose magic often floundered against her fury. After a lifetime of raucous battle, it was old age that eventually claimed her.  The sword was passed to her granddaughter, an adventurer, who presumably brought it to Amn.

The Pixie Prick almost appears to be a toy, so fine and delicate is the workmanship of the blade and handle.  Yet when wielded and the command word 'Sleep' is intoned, the tiny dagger glows with a blue nimbus.  Upon striking an opponent the Pixie Prick releases a surge of powerful magic, potentially inducing a deep slumber.  Legends say that the ancient sprite knight, Alfonso de Noble wielded the Pixie Prick, not as a dagger but as a two-handed sword.

@1039751 = ~You have our thanks for destroying our collars. If you are in search of the newest captives, you can find them in the northwest part of the complex. Perhaps they will have a way to save us from this forsaken prison.~ []
@1039763 = ~If that is what you wish... it will be safer than waiting here. I will wait outside by the palisade.~ [NALIA95]
@1039791 = ~Nalia has told you of the secret entrance, has she not? 'Tis to the north of the palisade, here, hidden in the wall of the keep behind some bushes.~ []
@1039822 = ~As you say, then. Had she told you of the way into the keep?  The secret entrance lies in the wall north of the palisade here, hidden behind some bushes.~ []
@1039831 = ~Despite her wishes, Nalia be betrothed to the Roenall family... a wealthy house renowned for their cruelty. I've no desire to work for such as them.~ []
@1039843 = ~I am relieved... perhaps the lass was right to go to you. Go, then... the secret entrance lies to the north of the palisade, here, hidden behind some bushes.~ []
@1040034 = ~I am betrothed, you see. Yes, some powerful associates of my Father roped me into that tired custom. I am to wed a brat of a man named Isaea Roenall.~ []
@1040087 = ~Have you given any more thought to my offer? Time is short and... I do not know how long I can stall the Roenalls.~ [NALIA67]
@1040104 = ~Incensed at your decisions, a crowd of angry peasants has stormed the gates of the keep, let in by mutinous guardsmen that also thought you abused your power as ruler of the land and manor.
As cries of rage traveled the halls you were forced to reluctantly escape through a side passage... even with your skills, a crowd of both peasants and guardsmen could not have been held off for long.

By the time you left the keep, the gentlefolk of the land had taken control of the building... likely waiting for knights from the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart or even a new lord to come from nearby. Either way, rule of the de'Arnise Keep has been stripped from you... permanently.~ []
@1040187 = ~I... I won't stand for this! This is far worse than if the Roenalls had taken over the keep! I won't let you take my family's land and run it into the ground!~ [NALIA79]
@1040188 = ~You can't just kill someone! You think you have that right because you run the keep?! What kind of monster ARE you?! Well... I won't stand for it!!~ [NALIA80]
@1040418 = ~Hahhr! Now 'at's what I likes to hear. I'm beginning to like this place, truly enough. But if I gets too much under your skin, you just lets me know.~ []
@1040441 = ~Nalia is too young to decide for herself to just give the land away. And the very idea is preposterous at the least! So... I'm going to be a gentleman and give you the choice to decide your fate for yourself.~ []
@1040531 = ~Preposterous! There is no such debt! I would know of it!~ []
@1040545 = ~This journal seems to be that of an apprentice mage, telling the tale of her expedition into the Umar Hills with two other apprentices in the search for evidence of the fabled witch. The tale is hard to believe, but seems to relate the group's horror at getting lost and being hounded by an unseen predator during the nights. The script is in a panicky, feminine hand and the last page can barely be made out as follows:

"... sorry to Joshellus' mother. I'm sorry about what happened to Michaelus. There's something out here with us. We thought it to be peasants but peasants aren't this clever. Joshellus says it's the witch. I hear her when I sleep. I don't want to sleep. I don't want to sleep. I don't want..."

The journal ends here.~ []
@1040689 = ~This keep is not your property! The Amnish Council has taken it over and will assign it to the proper nobility. You are unwelcome here... begone at once!~ []
@1040906 = ~Historically speaking, yes. I am an academic, not some cutesy well-bosomed relic hunter. You may be able to help me. Care to talk about a partnership of sorts?~ []
@1040962 = ~What? Blast, why did I waste my time on this idiotic plan. Did you hear that, Akae! You stupid plan has failed! We'll be doing it ourselves, just as I thought!~
@1041065 = ~Do you see? Do you see how our enemies fall? Obey your new guild, <CHARNAME>, and it will not be necessary for you to join the thieves in death. Obey, and you shall benefit Mistress Bodhi, and yourself.~ []
@1041190 = ~A problem has arisen, I fear. Strange noises and things going missing, <CHARNAME>. The actors are spooked... they think it's the curse.~ [BDHIGG10]
@1041204 = ~A coincidence. And my style is my own; do not be so petty. Perhaps if you were a better actress you would not worry so.~ []
@1041354 = ~Yes, I currently work for the Shadow Thieves.~ []
@1041355 = ~Yes, I currently work for the Shadow Thieves.~ []
@1041356 = ~Yes, I currently work for the Shadow Thieves.~ []
@1041462 = ~Shar will not dispel the despair of these actors.  There is no curse here, no magic.  But I would be pleased to go through the motions for you if it eases the cries of these frail rivvin.~
@1041611 = ~We open our play in the Turmish land, in the highest peaks of the Aphrunn, the nearest town away by weeks...~ []
@1041680 = ~We open our play in the Turmish land, in the highest peaks of the Aphrunn, the nearest town away by weeks...~ []
@1041733 = ~Stop it! We have to start somewhere. <CHARNAME>, if you would direct us in what our next assignment should be then we can begin.~ []
@1041740 = ~Stow it, Nara. I say we try our hand at making wands of death! ZeeOWWW!! That'll show 'em.~ []
@1041829 = ~Look, magic is dangerous! He knew it! You know it! I... I know it too. Let's... I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.~ []
@1042278 = ~But, seeing as how at least some of them survived your tutelage, you are cordially invited to the graduation ceremony, which will be held right here.~ []
@1042284 = ~Wait, I need to know if you can help me send these Solamnic Knights home.~ []
@1042327 = ~Good and good. Here is the rune. Be careful; it will only work on Lord Argrim and it has a frightfully long casting time.~ []
@1042515 = ~Do not get presumptuous with me, <GIRLBOY>... you do not want to provoke the wrath of the Cowled Wizards. But I have heard a little of what you speak.~ []
@1042763 = ~You seek Imoen, your lost comrade. I am prepared to give you her location, and the means with which to reach her.~ [BODHIX30]
@1042777 = ~It is true that Irenicus was your captor, and indeed, your stay in his care was not the most comfortable, but there were circumstances that you are not aware of.~
@1042779 = ~Irenicus requested a service of the Shadow Thieves, for which they demanded your capture as payment. You are of great interest to them, as you probably know.~ []
@1042794 = ~Trademeet is a peaceful town... we haven't even had the Sythillisian Empire to worry about, yet. And yet we are attacked by wild animals... it is almost beyond belief!~ []
@1042838 = ~That I cannot tell. Likely they wished to observe or interrogate. Either way, they wished you alive. That has probably changed with your recent actions, however.~ []
@1042840 = ~They're jus' waitin' for the big genie to come an' kill us all. The gods are angry. If not the genies, it'll be them Sythillisian ogres. One or the other.~ []
@1042845 = ~Sythillisian ogres?~ []
@1042847 = ~You don't know about th' genies holdin' all o' Trademeet hostage? They owns everythin'... gold, supplies, food. An' they won't give none of it up.~ []
@1042854 = ~It will not interfere. You will reach Irenicus and Imoen with ease, for they are both in the same place; a horrible place designed to hold the strong-willed.~ []
@1042888 = ~You!  You're the ones that have been behind all o' the town's troubles!  I knew you were nothing but trouble th' first time I laid eyes on you!~
@1042892 = ~Then it is a simple matter of retrieving Imoen from this place.~ []
@1042941 = ~She and the others involved in the disturbance were taken into custody, that much you know. They proved too unruly for simple incarceration.~ []
@1042991 = ~So you're all bluff and no bite, eh? Get outta here, before I tie your toes in a knot!~ []
@1043058 = ~Then it is a simple matter of retrieving Imoen from this place.~ []
@1043161 = ~I had toyed with forgetting the transgression, though it has not been that long in dragon terms. It was your other father that made me curious however.~ []
@1043348 = ~Either you pay their prices or ye has nothin', that's the way it be. Mayhap ye'll speak to Guildmistress Busya if ye wants to do somethin' about that.~ []
@1043480 = ~Ah, it is one of our wayfarers once again! Tell me, what can the Dao do for you this time, my friend?~ [TRGENI07]
@1043606 = ~The genies are hoarding all the food! I... I went to them yesterday and they were charging four coppers for a loaf of bread! I'm soooo hungry...~ []
@1043623 = ~Oh, I know that... that it must have been very difficult.  To save us from the beasts, I mean.  But... but we are no better off.  Not so long as those genies hoard our very food...~
@1043657 = ~Bodhi? Am I to be subservient to this foppish milksop?~ []
@1043837 = ~Greetings again, <CHARNAME>. Lady Lilith and Lord Skarmaen are not annoying you overmuch, I hope? Again, I urge you to be cautious.~ []
@1043863 = ~I have a name about this town, that is not spoken in polite company. My presence would prove more hindrance than help.~ []
@1043895 = ~There is a representative of the Cowled Wizards here as well. I know that he comes and goes whenever he pleases, so he must have a key or some such.~ []
@1044050 = ~All you need to know is that I wish to go there. I will pay for your help.~ []
@1044116 = ~Quit speaking in riddles you Cowled bastard! Where is Imoen?!~ []
@1044206 = ~Shut up! No questions! Make an appointment! The Coordinator speaks to no one! No one... speaks the Coordinator...~ [ppwane08]
@1044207 = ~He rules all, he does! You?! You are but the left bunion of his wondrous idol! You be grateful for the chance!~ [PPTIAX02]
@1044282 = ~Well, it be fine an' well that ye've taken care o' the assault o' nature on this town... but I will nay be joinin' in the celebration. With them genies hoardin' the gold, me trade is a mite constricted, aye?~ []
@1044394 = ~Trademeet will not be safe for long anyway, I think. You have heard of the Sythillisian Empire, yes? My cousin tells me we will be overrun by ogres and orcs within a month or so.~ []
@1044406 = ~I am Alenina, a minstrel from Tethyr. If you are traveling further south, you may wish to reconsider. I had difficulty passing the Sythillisian lines, myself, and now it would be even less likely to do so.~ []
@1044594 = ~A noble cause, but not easily accomplished. The Skin Dancer's lair is just north of the East Gate, in a walled-off section of town with an orange pavilion.~ []
@1044597 = ~I have found several clues. I suspect the creature's lair is just north of the East Gate, in a walled-off section of town with an orange pavilion.~ []
@1044615 = ~It is dead, as I said! Its... its body has crumbled... that is its nature...~ []
@1044620 = ~You assume you are a volunteer, but I don't need your co-operation. I will take the essence of you regardless.~ []
@1044923 = ~I wish nothing from you, save the satisfaction that you succeed in your goal. The winds are changing, and I must heed their gentle push.~ []
@1044943 = ~Iron Skins (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental
Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a druid casts this powerful spell upon herself, an outer skin of iron will move up from the ground completely covering her.  This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the druid in no way.  The effect of this is to protect the druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles.  For every two levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting.  For example, a 10th level druid would receive 5 skins.  For each skin the druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th level druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against him but the sixth would affect her normally.  The skins will remain on the druid until she is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks or the spell duration expires.  It is important to note that this will not protect the druid from any area attacks such as fireball.~
@1045061 = ~You're looking to be difficult, aren't you? I can accommodate that. I don't watch over this place because I'm helpless.~ []
@1045071 = ~This statue of Tyr towers over a private shrine, with de'Arnise ancestors mounted on the wall behind it.~ []
@1045081 = ~You know, I really preferred Wanev as director. It was a shame what Irenicus did to him. I will help you, I think. You may do as you wish with the inmates. I'll be back when this mess is cleared up.~ []
@1045339 = ~They were fightin', and we hoped they would split and go the straight an... uh... narrow. No luck though.~ []
@1045664 = ~What are you doing here without the horn? The sea gates are steadfastly locked until it is blown.~ []
@1045760 = ~Then I wish you well, but I won't go with you. I'll stay here and try to complete my plan on my own.~
@1045763 = ~I've heard whispers of a thieves' war... I don't know how there could be another guild as powerful as the Shadow Thieves, but maybe it is so.~ []
@1045882 = ~The Cowled Wizards keep their own counsel on that matter, I'm afraid. They keep their own prison, I imagine, but its location is kept a secret.~ []
@1045898 = ~Aw hell. Uh... I-I'll be below deck securing the... um... s-something, ah...~ [PPSAEM25]
@1046016 = ~Do not look so surprised. You must have expected to find me near your Imoen.~ [IRENIC36]
@1046021 = ~Oh, but I'm not incarcerated here. No, I am the new coordinator, and you are in my care... once again.~ [IRENIC37]
@1046107 = ~Well sported, sir. I shall have Desharik apprised of the results.~ []
@1046163 = ~Lord Arnise certainly kept varied company. I recognize very few people, least of all yourself. If you would excuse me...~
@1046213 = ~You believe the lies this ditch rat is spewing? Need I remind you how respected I am? I am Isaea Roenall.~ []
@1046237 = ~Then I have little choice but to forcefully show you the error of your ways. Nalia de'Arnise, I place you under arrest by order of the Amnish army.~ []
@1046241 = ~I have every right. I am an officer in the army and a liaison to the nobility. It is my function to see that everyone is well in their proper station.~ []
@1046261 = ~Lord Farthington Roenall~ []
@1046262 = ~Lord Farthington Roenall~ []
@1046272 = ~Isaea Roenall~ []
@1046295 = ~This document contains a register of slaves recently sold to this outpost of Slave Lords located in the Temple District. It also bears a signature in wax, pressed by a signet ring. It is the greater crest of the family Roenall, along with the individualized markings of Isaea Roenall. This is damning evidence if it is to be believed.~ []
@1046299 = ~Your kind has many names for us, I believe. We are called the Sea Devils and our eel-kin the Anguiliians, although I believe the merman word is most prevalent: Sahuagin...~ []
@1046383 = ~What does that scoundrel pay you to do?!~ []
@1046391 = ~Don't (hic) go getting mad and all. Never harmed a soul in my life. Relieved a few of their purses, but never harmed 'em.~ []
@1046399 = ~You don't know if you have more worth than a sea crab? It's tempting to taste for myself. But then, a scrumptious <PRO_RACE> might come in handy...~ []
@1046417 = ~Sekolah demands perseverance, strength and self-reliance! But not stupidity... the priestesses shall heal you before you fight, surface <PRO_RACE>.~ []
@1046430 = ~Congratulations, my wondrous little <PRO_RACE>! You are, indeed, a mighty specimen... and the one sent to us by Sekolah, I might add.~ []
@1046442 = ~N-no, most exalted one. As... as long as the prophesied ones deal with the rebels, they will have served the purpose Sekolah intended...~ []
@1046576 = ~You are not the one who was prophesied to save us. Indeed, you have destroyed us! The Prince and the exiles were our last chance to keep our bloodline strong!~ []
@1046580 = ~You are not the one who was prophesied to save us. Indeed, you have destroyed us! The Prince and the exiles were our last chance to keep our bloodline strong!~ []
@1046665 = ~The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different part of Faerun.

@1046851 = ~Rescue Raelis and Haer'Dalis from the planar prison.

The Master of Thralls' dwarven slave has told me how to destroy the orb: a room I passed through contains a magical brazier in its center, the flames of which will destroy the item and release those who wear the collars...leaving the warden unprotected.~

Named for Prince Rashad, former ruler of a minor principality to the East, this blade and many of the Prince's possessions were taken by disgruntled palace guards after his death. The role of the guards in the unfortunate affair was never determined, but rumor has it that all died within a year, slain by this very weapon.

@1046924 = ~But enter them I did, Barl. I found alchemists' poisons, bottles and a holy symbol of Talona. You have betrayed Waukeen.~ []

@1047578 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

While I was not able to catch Rejiek Hidesman, I have at least stopped his reign of terror in Athkatla and sent him fleeing.

Well, Jan Jansen's fine has been paid to the jailkeep... who was eager enough to see the garrulous gnome leave that he lent me 200 gp. He does expect to be paid back, though. I suppose the only thing to do now is to tell Jan he's free.~ []
@1047991 = ~Jan Jansen returns to his home in the slums.

This Vorpal Silver Sword radiates a dark aura when you examine it, and the blade is so finely sharpened it could likely sever a head in a single blow.

@1048838 = ~Yup. You just wait... I'll be renowned as the greatest halfling sorcerer around Faerun in years to come! Just you wait!~ []
@1048852 = ~(sniff)  Ahh, even Boo cringes from such a foul odor. Surely this instrument will never make beautiful music again.~ []
@1048860 = ~Isaea Roenall. Certainly you know him.~ []
@1048867 = ~Well, indeed I do know Isaea Roenall. I know him well enough that he would never tell our dealings to another person!~ []
@1048871 = ~Our mutual friend, Isaea Roenall.~ []
@1048884 = ~I do not support this Vittorio's actions, but I cannot stand by and watch him hurt. If we do not look for this... this gong... then we must stop the Captain from exacting vengeance.~ []
@1048916 = ~Chaos~ []
@1048973 = ~Madness! The singleminded nature of the Rashemeni but with even less sense!~ []
@1048982 = ~I have little doubt, <CHARNAME>, that we will also find Lieutenant Aegisfield somewhere herein... hopefully the man is still alive.~ []
@1049050 = ~Child of Nature, you are again needed. Balance is threatened and Chaos is at the periphery. Will you serve the Grove?~ []
@1049247 = ~<CHARNAME> is taking a chance by <PRO_HISHER> action... but compassion must be granted to even the least of our brethren. Would you not have the Order take a chance on you, hm?~ []
@1049382 = ~Fools! The Master will brook no incompetence! You are to clean his favorite golems and you do work too poorly! The Master is furious! He values his golems more than a hundred of you!!~ []
@1049543 = ~Pfeh. If it be a struggle between conscience and gold, I can count on one of me hands the number of seconds 'twould take to resolve such a dispute. Begone with yer blather, girl.~ []
@1049588 = ~We can't just leave him. Well, we should at least find who he's talking about or... or find him some help? Please, <CHARNAME>? We can't just let someone die...~ []

@1049988 = ~You are ignorant, even for a human. Fortunately for you, Arvoreen calls for patience for such as you, or I would strike you down where you stand for such blasphemy.~ []
@1049992 = ~Calm yourself, rivvil. Or slice your own throat upon your knife, I truly do not care. The amount of hysteria your kind experiences by my mere presence is laughable.~ []
@1050024 = ~It's nothing, Aerie, I will be fine. Do not worry yourself.~ []
@1050031 = ~It felt like I wasn't in total control of myself for a moment. It has passed.~ []
@1050096 = ~Your weakness is betrayed by the quiver in your voice, rivvil! Your precious eye tyrant is so much dust and you shall join him before the hour is through!~ []
@1050172 = ~I paid my dues when rivvin attempted to burn me at the stake, elg'caress. Ask me again to pay for the 'privilege' of visiting your city and you will forfeit your tongue.~ []
@1050251 = ~Mmm-hmm. Very convincing, Vicky. Next thing you know, she'll be administering to the sick and setting up a program for disenchanted prostitutes. "Oh, dear," we'll moan, "whatever happened to our wicked little Vicky?" ... ehhh... or maybe not.~ []
@1050269 = ~If that is how it must be. Here, take the deed and prepare yourself.~ []
@1050418 = ~It will be worth it in the end, I promise. I would not venture into this place if I did not think it warranted the risk. If you can help, please do.~ []
@1050423 = ~You see, I anticipated something like this. I have made myself indispensable to the project. I will compensate you fairly, I assure you. ~ []
@1050427 = ~Then we are at an impasse that can only be solved with violence. I am sorry that it came to this yet again. Raise your weapons, I have no choice!~ []
@1050470 = ~Still, if you are so insistent I suppose that I could up your reward a bit more, though I reserve the right to take the majority for myself.~ []
@1050472 = ~That is sufficient. I thank you for your generosity.~ []
@1050524 = ~Why does my own mind ask the length of its stay? Do I taunt myself now? Trapped I am, and this is naught but a figment! A dream!~ []
@1050529 = ~You are confused... perhaps mad. Calm yourself or you will come to harm.~ []
@1050535 = ~I'm glad to hear it. The fact of the matter is, Logan's lily-footing ways will fail. I wonder if the fool even wants to stop the mad druids!~ []
@1050583 = ~And what is your place? To stand at the fore and fling accusations? I have survived more self-righteous rivvin than you, and done far less harm!~ []
@1050586 = ~I can survive, addled one. I was taken by surprise today, but I have been among rivvin secretly for quite some time. But neither do I object to traveling with you.~ []
@1050657 = ~You turn a page in the ancient tome, and a magic portal suddenly opens, spawning a blood-thirsty monster!~
@1050679 = ~A wise tactic to split an opponent's force with magic. Your kind are tricky adversaries, Drow. I will not fall victim to the same again.~ []
@1050694 = ~Hmph. I misjudged you, coward. Run along then and play by Logan's lily-livered rules. When I come to power you shall no longer be welcome in Trademeet.~ []
@1050737 = ~Good. Take the poison. The druids have a lair in the northeast section of the Grove. The font will be there. I shall be at the tavern when you have completed the task. Hurry!~
@1050781 = ~de'Arnise Signet Ring~ []
@1050818 = ~de'Arnise Signet Ring

This ring was given to Nalia by her father upon her ascension to adulthood.  Bonded to her blood as it is, the ring may not be removed from Nalia, nor its powers used by anyone else.  The ring grants a +2 bonus to all saving throws, +2 armor class bonus, and 50% resistance to fire.~
@1051029 = ~Although I... appreciate... the thought behind your words. Handmaiden Imrae enjoyed administering her punishment excessively. It was... difficult.~ []
@1051151 = ~Leave me be, female. Your kind has given me more than enough grief to last me a millennium. Is it not bad enough that I was dragged here against my will?~ [UDSOLA13]
@1051176 = ~I do not know why you taunt me, though. You are no surfacers, you are Drow of Ust Natha. He said surfacers rescued him.~ []
@1051195 = ~That is too bad, <PRO_MALEFEMALE>, because you have no choice in the matter. Perform poorly and have nothing... or perform well and be rewarded well.~ []
@1051210 = ~Your words ring true... you have a forceful presence, you do. I believe your tale.~ []
@1051364 = ~The temple marks where the elves of dark hearts first descended, truly separating from Elven kind and becoming Drow.~ []
@1051666 = ~His insolence is beyond all endurance. I cannot tolerate it further without risking my position in Lolth's hierarchy.~ []
@1051691 = ~As you place your last item within its statue, the chest in the center of the chamber slams open. There is something within that was not there before.~ []
@1051770 = ~'The system of tokenage has been set to thy precise specifications. The machine will dispense quality footwear upon the placement of mithril tokens within the slot. Surreptitiously, Grophinet - thy Jester'~ []
@1051884 = ~Scimitar +3: 'Water's Edge'
The blade of this weapon seems to shimmer, revealing a fluid, razor edge. Truly there was great skill involved in its construction, as well as a blessing or two from some well-meaning eye above, even though the hilt is comparatively almost clumsily adorned.

@1053296 = ~Come, now, Drizzt... if this be the dire bandit who jumped ye while ye fought the gnolls, then let us dispatch <PRO_HIMHER> and be back to the Ten Towns where we be truly needed.~ []

@1053843 = ~It is hard to put a value on truly pleasing company such as my own. Let us say 100 gold.~ []
@1053877 = ~It is too dangerous... I could be killed for telling you...~ []
@1053888 = ~She has... cells in the Guildhouse. A cruel dark prison where she places those who displease her. Claire could be there or she could already be dead. Galvena does not allow us to leave.~ []

@1055117 = ~An innocent... completely unknown to you and conjured from the realm of the prime material plane, a human of... good and decent nature... will do very nicely. Go to my left and sacrifice for the innocent. Go to my right and save yourself.~ [HELSEL14]
@1055124 = ~A selfless act, from one who willingly shoulders the burden of Destiny and its effects upon others. The innocent lives... and shall be returned whence he came.~ [HELSEL18]
@1055211 = ~What... wha-what is this place?! I died, I'm sure of it, and I felt... I felt a dragging, a pulling, to this place. It was you, wasn't it? You brought me here in your... in your wake.~ [VALYGA83]
@1055212 = ~I died, indeed. I... would not be here, normally, except I knew this was not finished, this battle. I felt your tugging and I came willingly... Mazzy Fentan has never backed away from a battle.~ [MAZZY90]
@1055214 = ~Eh? Oh, the Nine Hells, is it? Hmph. Yes, I felt your infernal power tugging at me, but I was coming here anyway. There might be profit, yet, by remaining at your side... we'll see.~ [EDWIN90]
@1055319 = ~That old tune? I grow tired of being judged by those inferior to me. First Suldanessellar, now you. They... they told of the theft in their temple, didn't they!~ []
@1055372 = ~Spell trigger is much like spell sequencer in that it allows the caster to store several spells in a trigger item that can be released upon any target, including the caster. The spells stored in the sequencer are cast as any other spell and can be accessed through the special abilities button on the main screen. It is important to note that when you choose the spells to be stored in the trigger, they will disappear from the ones you have memorized. However, the trigger will last until used so the caster may rest and gain those spells back. The main use for this spell would be to allow the caster to release multiple spells upon a target very quickly in combat without the possibility of being interrupted.~ []
@1055551 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: A Baron's request.

Baron Metrich wishes a number of squatters removed, and has cited recent violence against his men as just cause for such action. I must go to the neutral meeting place, a tavern in the Umar Hills, in the village of Imnesvale. I must restore order and bring favor on our name.~ []
@1055571 = ~Cleric Stronghold: how to heal a cuckold?

I have advised Glinden that he should ignore his wife's infidelity. His marriage will continue despite this simple indiscretion.~ []
@1055573 = ~Cleric Stronghold: how to heal a cuckold?

I have advised Glinden that he should remind his wife of her duty to their vows. She will understand that duty is all-important.~ []
@1055577 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander was well served.

Stressing self-sacrifice for the love of another was in the true spirit of the teachings of Lathander, and Glinden and his wife have benefitted. I have served the church well.~
@1055578 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander was not served.

I have not done well in the eyes of Lathander. I should have stressed that Glinden adopt a more self-sacrificing love for his wife. Instead, they are unhappy and church doctrine is unsatisfied.~ []
@1055603 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Helm is not pleased.

I was too lenient on Rania and her weakened faith. Duty should have been better stressed. If she could not stand up to such, she is not worthy of Helm.~ []
@1055629 = ~Mage Stronghold: Ambush!

Teos had not summoned me to the sphere. It was an ambush to get us both. We were attacked by a strange assailant. He screamed about the 'glory of Argrim.'~ []
@1055633 = ~Mage Stronghold: Apprentice crap.

Apparently those apprentices that were dumped on me were supposed to take instruction and make what I directed. I have no time to care, so I just cut them loose. Let's see what they can do on their own. Might be a bit dangerous, but they have to learn sometime, right?~ []
@1055666 = ~Pretties, you say? Do you mean... gems? Have you any faculties left? Can you remember?~
@1055668 = ~This young minstrel has lost his wits and his songs? Minds are common enough, but tunes of merit are few and far between.~ []
@1055680 = ~Yes! Such fire and conviction! A pity there are no actual enemies to warrant the screaming, but good show anyway. Boo applauds!~ []
@1055747 = ~I am loath to listen too closely to the words of the human, but his advice may be wise. Let us at least see if these mad wizards can be released... and harnessed.~
@1055749 = ~All bluster and balderdash, ain't ya. Uncle Chester Bellowsbreath was like that too, talking himself so big that you'd swear he was ten feet tall, which was not too far off considering he had a strange disorder stemming from an obscenity hurled at a passing wizard one drunken eve in Waterdeep. Stomp and pomp all ye wish, but it would do you well to take the simple advice of never telling Khelben Blackstaff to "put a shine on that thing and stop being so darned pompous with yer dark-cornered mysteriosity," and if you do, don't punctuate it with a rotten turnip at high velocity.~ []
@1055882 = ~Don't be worried, Aerie. I'm here to protect my witch. Boo, too, though I think he would leap to protect anyone in distress. It's his heroic nature, you know.~ []
@1055886 = ~So I am in my homeland once again. Already I feel how unwelcome it has become. My eyes are no longer used to its darkness and my senses to the hint of the threat around every corner.~ [VICONIB5]
@1055889 = ~A most underhanded maneuver, <CHARNAME>. Although I am sure it is no less than Phaere might have planned for us. There is an ironic justice in this, no?~ []

@1055950 = ~As a drow on the surface, he should expect such treatment. If I tracked down every rivvil who has wronged me, I would end up doing little else.~ []
@1055966 = ~This Drow is well respected by the Harpers, <CHARNAME>. I will not assist you fighting him. I will return to Athkatla; consider your idiocy before we speak again.~ []
@1055971 = ~When Evil was torn asunder, 3 pieces were locked away. For a millennium I have guarded this piece, dispensing death to those that follow Darkness. ~
@1055995 = ~Yet, you had a key, a Rogue Stone. What did you hope to accomplish by trespassing in my chamber?~ []
@1055996 = ~Athkatla? Hardly. The portal is known only to my creatures and yet you had a key, a Rogue Stone. What did you hope to accomplish by trespassing in my chamber?~ []
@1056013 = ~I hope you are right, Nalia. We must take care to not upset the natural balance of this region.~ []
@1056151 = ~They cannot make us do this, can they? To house us together that we might speak... then force us to fight... it is monstrous. Or do you taunt us?~ []
@1056155 = ~And here would come the change in plans, am I right? Wondrously chaotic plan if it is. I expected no less.~ []
@1056169 = ~To stave off your wrath they have provoked it beyond imagining. These are impressive risks they are willing to take.~ []
@1056172 = ~An improvement, I think. One that you should relish as a brief glimpse of your betters.~ []
@1056243 = ~I was talking to him, not to you! You've made your feelings on everything apparent enough!~ [AERIED3]
@1056255 = ~I was just asking for his opinion... is that so bad, Jaheira?~ [AERIEE1]
@1056274 = ~I will tell you what would make this journey more pleasant. Not having to listen to the constant whimpering of a wounded dove.~ [VICONIC6]
@1056298 = ~Oh, come now, child. I have been listening to your simpering for quite some time, and it begins to grate on my nerves. You are in this group to help, as I recall... pull yourself together!~ [JAHEIRF7]
@1056345 = ~If I need to hear from our resident wingless pigeon, I will bang on a drum. Otherwise, return to your pathetic cowering and let me speak.~ [VICONIC3]
@1056407 = ~This appears to be the statue described in the Vampiricus Omnibus. The book spoke of placing the vampire and its master's heart within the statue's arms to destroy the curse.~ []
@1056551 = ~I have no fear for his well-being, monster.~
@1056590 = ~I know of no cure for vampirism at this stage. Perhaps the followers of Oghma may have a tome in their collection that can help. I can offer no more than this.~ []
@1056593 = ~I know of no cure. Seek the followers of Oghma, the god of knowledge. They might have a text on the subject, for they are great collectors of knowledge. That is all I can offer.~ []
@1056596 = ~Legends of the Lanthorn maintain that it was perhaps once a mere carriage light, but that our ancestors did light the way to new lands with it at the fore of their processions.~ []
@1056658 = ~I knew you wouldn't let me down. You followed... and I'll follow you, <CHARNAME>. I'll follow wherever you lead.~ []
@1056668 = ~Then this place is as much your tomb as it is mine. If my body, that... that thing... does not die, you shall never escape. Only my hand shall open the way. Thus has Bodhi ordained it.~ []
@1056671 = ~There is a secret room near the Tome of Madness. Within, the shaman worships the shard, now grown. Use the stake to kill my body and get the hand.~
@1056672 = ~The hand is half of the key! The crystal is the other! You shall know both when you find them. Find them not and you will die here.~ []
@1056679 = ~We can rest if you wish. I do not understand what Irenicus did, but Boo has said that it was traumatic and I will guard if we must stay here a while.~ []
@1056790 = ~No, I'll sell you nothing. For all I know, you could be a devotee of that harlot, Eilistraee, and I'll not be punished by the Handmaidens by selling you anything. Away with you!~ []
@1056809 = ~It would be better if you left the Liaison alone. Dealing with Illithid is tiring at best.~ []
@1056863 = ~As with other magical bags, this one appears to be a common cloth sack of about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space, and its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into this item, the bag always weighs a fixed amount.~
@1056882 = ~Oh, I'm certain that it is. But for whose benefit? Our knowledge of you is tenuous at best. How long should we wait before you prove your good intentions?~ []
@1056895 = ~Trinkets? You expect to appease us with a few baubles we could have found at the local bazaar? We have more important things to worry about!~ []
@1056953 = ~Aye, I've heard o' the black runt. A foppish mercenary, I hears, famous an' loaded with magic. 'Twould not stand up to me axe, I think, but he sounds fearsome enough.~ []
@1057150 = ~Ahhh, precious, aren't they? To think the Jae'llat have squirreled away such beauty for a millennium.  What do you figure they'll get on the market, Visaj?~ []
@1057177 = ~Kill the lich and loot his tower before the Sorcere mages close it. Take the wardstone for the Jae'llat household... more riches await you there, if you attack.~ []

@1057313 = ~Of the house... Despana. I see. Do not think yourself free of all responsibility. That house is strong, but no stronger than mine!~ []
@1057322 = ~I will appease you as best I can. It was merely my fear that made me obstinate.~ []

I tell you, he got so involved in the tasting that he fell into the keg up to his ankles the wrong way around, and had to breathe through the spigot for three hours lest he drown in a watery tomb of his own making.

Melissan has warned me that the fire giant Bhaalspawn is immune to all weapons and magic.  Unless I can find some way to overcome his resistances any attempt to destroy him is doomed to failure.

Perhaps the secret to defeating him can be found in a swamp deep within the Forest of Mir, where Yaga-Shura was raised.  It is also possible that a cult of fire giants in the Marching Mountains knows a way to nullify Yaga-Shura's power.~

If I set the air mage's fan on high and open all the doors between the fan room, my own lab and the ice wizard's frigid chamber, the drafts will blow my toxic vapors down the hall towards the frost wizard's minions.  Once touched by the poison gas they will become tainted and vulnerable.  That snowblind fool won't know what hit him!

I can then close the doors or turn the fan back to the low setting, and the gas will drift back into my noxious lab to preserve my own precious pets.~

The others refuse to recognize my contribution to this project!  When the Demon assumes the shape of a winged, red-bodied beast it becomes vulnerable to my powerful winter magics, yet my "companions" insist their own enchantments surpass my own.

The flame mage, with his "invincible" servant, is the worst, of course.  But I have discovered the secret to destroying his precious giant!  

The fire elementals are the key - dispatch them and the giant becomes vulnerable!  I will lure each of the four elementals into my ice lab, and destroy them in my frozen realm.  This will trap their spirits in the ice crystals, and keep them from being reborn in the lava pit from which they are continually spawned!~

@1066453 = ~The Heart of the Damned is an ancient dried human heart. It takes its name from the legend of the man that it came from. Legend has it that during a war, the cause of which has long been forgotten, a keep was besieged. The Lord of the keep knew that his walls would soon be overrun and, rather than have his people enslaved, he slew them all. When the besiegers next attacked, they found the Lord standing amongst the slain.

The Lord was burned at the stake and the legends say that his heart would not burn. The Heart is an artifact of significant malevolent power and may be of some use.

But Gabber was determined to learn to talk. He did tongue exercises and tongue stretches everyday, and his tongue kept getting longer and more nimble the more he worked with it. They say he was able to pick locks with his unusual appendage, though I never had the privilege of witnessing that feat myself.

@1068507 = ~Oh yes, she was a fine-looking woman... to Kimble's eyes, at least.  She cast a spell on him far stronger than any sorcerer ever could.

Even before I left Suldanessellar, the news had already begun pouring in from everywhere...tales of armies on the move, whole towns being destroyed to get at some lone wizard, massive carnage and destruction along the entire Sword Coast.  It all links to the Bhaalspawn.  They are being hunted, or hunting each other...whatever the case, wherever a Child of Bhaal is, violence soon follows.  And so the fear and panic have spread, with any innocent even suspected of having the taint being driven from their homes or killed outright.

Even the elven lands are not immune, and I sensed considerable relief upon my departure from the very city that I helped save.  Ellesime, at least, offered me some advice...there is a part of the old elven woods that house old ancestor spirits of the elves, spirits locked within giant carved faces made so long ago not even the elves remember when they were created.  It is a sacred place reserved only for royalty, but Ellesime is allowing me to enter the dale and glean what wisdom I can.

I have gone alone...none of the elven forest folk want to be near me.  And while no others are supposed to be here, I am sure that danger stalks me, yet.  I should prepare my weapons and equipment and be ready for anything...~
@1073292 = ~Yaga-Shura's army pours towards you, led by the giant Bhaalspawn himself, and you realize that you shall have to kill Yaga-Shura if you wish to break their ranks. If you fail to kill him soon, you may be overrun.~ []
@1073383 = ~As you wish. I urge you godspeed. Without my spellbook I have no way to restock my inventory with the precious scrolls I normally carry.~ []
@1073384 = ~Iycanth's Eyestalk

I have subcontracted the Eyestalk Quest to Bondari and his idiot friends. They did quite well though Nanoc seemed less than pleased with Tim's performance. Tim has Magic Missile.~ []
@1073405 = ~I do have such a scroll, and I will gladly trade it for my spellbook... but the scroll is useless. Yaga-Shura's mages have cast powerful spells imprisoning us here.~ []
@1073467 = ~Oh, sure... just cause I'm a street urchin I have to know about stolen books! Everyone always blames me! 'Squip stole this!'  'Squip took that!'  You got no proof!~ []
@1073729 = ~The Graveyard Lich

Vongoethe has gotten what he wanted from Marlowe, who was more or less willing to have it over with in the end. I have the soul of the girl in its crystalline cage, now, and could restore her if I wished.~ []
@1073822 = ~To Yaga-Shura's Lair~ []
@1073851 = ~This scroll has a simple unique teleport spell on it, that would allow someone to teleport outside of Saradush's walls, if Yaga-Shura's mages had not erected a shield. But using it now would surely be fatal.~ []
@1073900 = ~Peragath the Valiant, a great champion of the Order of the Radiant Heart, carried this shield into battle against a horde of invading Tanar'ri pouring through a gate to the Astral Plane.  Gripped by holy fervor, the mighty paladin single-handedly drove back the horde, then foolishly leapt through the Astral gate to finish them off.  The gate collapsed, and both Peragath and the shield were forever lost in the Planes.

@1073911 = ~Some believe this massive blade to be of Drow origin, though others dispute this claim.  However, all agree this great sword was fashioned with a single purpose... to rid the world of the Illithid. Those who wield the Psion's Blade are immune to the Mind Flayer's psionic attacks.  The bewildering gaze of Umber Hulks, often found serving the Illithid, are similarly rendered harmless.

@1073918 = ~Nalia grew quite powerful after her association with <CHARNAME>. Initially she traveled, learning magical lore and making influential friends, but after a year she returned to Amn and her family home of de'Arnise Keep. She found it in the control of none other than Isaea Roenall, but she was no longer the wayward child that he expected, and single-handedly brought him to justice for his indiscretions. She declared herself the inheritor of her father's ducal title, becoming a beloved ruler, respected archmage, and eventually earning a seat on the Amnish Council of Six itself. She would become a prominent figure in Amn for many years, constantly fighting for the good of the common folk and making many frustrated enemies among the nobility and Cowled Wizards both.~ []
@1073921 = ~No longer with <CHARNAME>, Viconia went on to found a cult dedicated to Shar in the city of Waterdeep. One of her followers betrayed her, however, prompting the slaughter of the whole tainted lot. Shar admonished Viconia strongly for this, but she was unrepentant and again wandered the Realms. Viconia was still formidable, and went on to prevent an attempt by the Knights of the Shield to take over Calimport, and even worked with Drizzt Do'Urden to save the elven city of Suldanessellar from a Zhentarim plot. For this last act, the elves accepted her, and Queen Ellesime bestowed the highest honors of the Seldarine, an accolade never before given to one of her dark kind. Viconia reportedly bowed once without emotion, and then left. Her fate remains unknown.~ []
@1073946 = ~Elminster's Ecologies: Appendix IIIa

This time-worn tome is written by the sage Elminster, and apparently part of a much larger body of work containing detailed studies of most of the strange creatures from around Faerun.  

The appendix seems to refer to newly-discovered variations on normal breeds of creatures.  Of particular interest:

"Dense Puddings - a relative of the slimes and molds, this pudding is relatively normal...except when exposed to electricity or fire.  When this occurs, it splits into new puddings and can therefore be very dangerous."

"Fire Trolls - a new form of troll thought to have been created by sorcerous Fire Giants for use as servants and guards.  They are similar to regular trolls in most respects except for their lava-temperature skin and burning touch.  Once they are defeated, they can only be permanently killed by cold or acid."

"Fission Slime - an off-shoot of the slimes and molds, this particular slime will split into new and independent creatures when hit.  It is vulnerable to fire, which will kill it permanently."

"Magic Golems - this rare type of golem is formed from pure magical energy and is completely immune to spellcraft as well as enchanted weapons.  To my knowledge, only weapons without enchantments have any effects on this creature."

"Mariliths - while this is apparently a legitimate form of demon, it is one that only an exceptional few have encountered and survived.  The Marilith is a six-armed demon with a human female front half and the back half of a snake.  She is incredibly quick and deadly, and on top of her martial prowess with six swords, she casts spells as well.  Fighters should beware: in addition to being immune to normal weapons and minor enchantments, this demon also likes to cast Immunity to Magic Weapons...which must be dispelled if a fighter is to have any chance with his armaments."~
